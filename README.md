# My Portfolio

## Description

I made a portfolio using React, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. It displays my projects and skills, along with a way to contact me!
- I built this project to learn more about styling in React. I definitely feel like I've gotten better with it.
- I learned to double check your code maybe even quintuple check it because, one little capitlization error can cause a meltdown
